# HAL-Viewer

A viewer for a hal+json API.   
It is inspired by the [hal-browser](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser).
The hal-browser shows the content of the hal+json response in a way that is suitable for a developer.
The hal-viewer tries to present the content in a user-friendly way.

## Usage

Just open the index.html in a browser.
It will ask for an entry point, or you can provide one by adding `entry_point=YOUR_URL` as a query parameter.
